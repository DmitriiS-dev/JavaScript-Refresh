# JavaScript-Refresh

A quick refresh on Node.js and JavaScript. This script fetches product data from a URL, processes an input array of product UIDs, and calculates the total quantity, subtotals, and overall total for the products. It uses the https module to make requests and handles the data asynchronously.
